Javascript Checker
==================

This is mostly a library for creating short-hands to common
boolean expressions used for input validation. For example,

- *Checking if input is a non-empty Array*
- *Testing if input is an object with the necessary fields*

This library was developed in order to cut down on coding time required for front-end facing input validation, as well as provide a reliable and consistent method of performing input validation. This reduces the probability of validation leaks and allows for any validation leaks to be easily plugged thoughout the whole application.
